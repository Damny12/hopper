# Welcome to Hopper's source code!
Hopper is a programming language that I have wanted to make for a while.\
It is able to **hop** using the ``` hop ``` command.

### Hopping
Hopping skips to a specified line in code starting at zero.
```
This text will be ignored because it is not a command.
hop(3) This text will also be ignored because it is not a command.
print(This will be skipped over)
print(This will be printed)
```
### Strings
There are currently no air qoutes in strings.
